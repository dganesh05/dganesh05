Hey there! 👋

I'm Divya, a Data Science & Machine Learning student at UNC Charlotte. 

I love building mini projects and data mining. My values for project-building lie in finding the inconveniences in my life and solving them—at least, that's how I start out😉. My favorite projects are the ones that move beyond "cool tech" to actually make someone's day easier.

As for data, I don't just analyze it—I find actionable insights and build solutions that solve real problems.

My main tech stack is **Python, React, and JavaScript**. I'm currently learning **TypeScript** to level up my full-stack game.

Right now, I'm working on:
- **[Tydier](https://github.com/dganesh05/tydier)** – an AI-powered bookmark organizer using clustering algorithms and LLMs to turn chaos into clean, hierarchical folders
- **[Smart Link Cleaner](https://github.com/dganesh05/smart-link-cleaner)** – a browser extension that automatically removes trackers and traces links back to their source

I won **1st place** at the HAVK Data Visualization Competition by analyzing NYC taxi data and quantifying the "hidden congestion tax" on commuters.

Fun Facts: 
- I tutor Calculus and beginner frontend dev on the side
- Currently getting into Five Nights at Freddy's and the Persona series
- Love musical theatre—Hamilton is my favorite, but I'm diving into Epic the Musical next
- I'm a cat person 🐱
